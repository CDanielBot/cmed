There are sets of node ids which contain partly-contiguous ranges of node ids.

The first part of the exercise is to (in a language of your choice) model the ranges in a space efficient manner.


An example set: a/1, a/2, a/3, a/4, a/128, a/129, b/65, b/66, c/1, c/10, c/42


Secondly, given the model already developed, write an algorithm that will add two sets, merging any overlapping ranges.

For example 
Set A (same as example for part 1): a/1, a/2, a/3, a/4, a/128, a/129, b/65, b/66, c/1, c/10, c/42 
Set B: a/1, a/2, a/3, a/4 a/5, a/126, a/127, b/100, c/2, c/3, d/1

Set A + Set B should contain: a/1, a/2, a/3, a/4, a/5, a/126, a/127, a/128, a/129, b/65, b/66, b/100, c/1, c/2, c/3, c/10, c/42, d/1
